FREAD(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            FREAD(3)

NAME
       fread, fwrite - binary stream input/output

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

       size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb,
                     FILE *stream);

DESCRIPTION
       The  function  fread() reads nmemb items of data, each size
       bytes long, from the stream pointed to by  stream,  storing
       them at the location given by ptr.

       The function fwrite() writes nmemb items of data, each size
       bytes long, to the stream pointed to by  stream,  obtaining
       them from the location given by ptr.

       For nonlocking counterparts, see unlocked_stdio(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, fread() and fwrite() return the number of items
fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error,
       and callers must use feof(3)  and  ferror(3)  to  determine
       which occurred.
